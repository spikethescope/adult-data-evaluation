## Adult Dataset Classifier Evaluation Using Random Forest and Decision Tree

# Description

This repository contains code to evaluate the performance of two classification models, random forest and decision tree, on the Adult dataset. The Adult dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for classification tasks, containing information about individuals' demographics and income. The goal of the evaluation is to determine which model performs better in predicting whether an individual has an income greater than $50,000 per year.

# Metrics

The following metrics will be used to evaluate the models:

*ROC curve:* The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that measures the performance of a binary classifier. It plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds. The TPR is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly classified, and the FPR is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified. A higher ROC curve indicates a better performing model.

*Cross-validation*: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on unseen data. It involves splitting the training data into multiple folds, and then training the model on each fold while evaluating it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for all folds, and the average performance is reported. Cross-validation helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization performance.

*Grid search*: Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves training a model on a grid of different hyperparameter values and selecting the values that produce the best performance on the validation set. Hyperparameters are parameters that control the learning process of a machine learning model, such as the number of trees in a random forest or the maximum depth of a decision tree.

*Feature importance*: Feature importance is a measure of how important each feature is to the performance of a machine learning model. It can be used to identify the most important features for predicting the target variable. This information can be used to improve the model's performance by removing irrelevant features or engineering new features.

# Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the following command to train and evaluate the models:
python train_and_evaluate.py
This will produce a report containing the ROC curves, cross-validation scores, and feature importance for both models.

# Conclusion

This repository provides a simple and easy-to-use way to evaluate the performance of random forest and decision tree models on the Adult dataset. The code can be used as a starting point for your own machine learning projects, or to learn more about the different metrics that can be used to evaluate classification models.
