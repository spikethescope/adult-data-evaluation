#BASIC ADULT DATASET EVALUATION 
Adult dataset classifier evaluation using random forest and decision tree is a machine learning task to compare the performance of two classification models, random forest and decision tree, on the Adult dataset. The Adult dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for classification tasks, containing information about individuals' demographics and income. The goal of the evaluation is to determine which model performs better in predicting whether an individual has an income greater than $50,000 per year.  To evaluate the models, we will use a variety of metrics, including:  ROC curve: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that measures the performance of a binary classifier. It plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds. The TPR is the proportion of positive cases that are correctly classified, and the FPR is the proportion of negative cases that are incorrectly classified. A higher ROC curve indicates a better performing model. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on unseen data. It involves splitting the training data into multiple folds, and then training the model on each fold while evaluating it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for all folds, and the average performance is reported. Cross-validation helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more accurate estimate of the model's generalization performance. Grid search: Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves training a model on a grid of different hyperparameter values and selecting the values that produce the best performance on the validation set. Hyperparameters are parameters that control the learning process of a machine learning model, such as the number of trees in a random forest or the maximum depth of a decision tree. Feature importance: Feature importance is a measure of how important each feature is to the performance of a machine learning model. It can be used to identify the most important features for predicting the target variable. This information can be used to improve the model's performance by removing irrelevant features or engineering new features.
